# Graylog Extractors for VyOS

Welcome!

This package installs [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org) [Extractors](https://docs.graylog.org/docs/extractors) for [VyOS](https://vyos.io). Extractors are included for firewall and prometheus-node-exporter messages.

If you have anything to add, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Information
I've rebuilt my graylog instance in my homelab a handful of times in the past and always relied on available Ubiquiti EdgeRouter content packs. Upon rebuilding my network using a VyOS VM as the router, the patterns were different enough that the EdgeRouter content packs were no longer helpful.

After rebuilding my graylog instance in Docker in a fresh VM, I spent my afternoon putting together this group of about 30 extractors that will process various syslog messages from VyOS hosts and extract useful information from the messages for visualization. Extractors are based on grok patterns, which you can learn more about in the **Using Grok Patterns to Extract Data** section here: https://docs.graylog.org/docs/extractors

Hopefully this ready-to-go package of input extractors for VyOS VMs helps save someone an afternoon of trial and error. Cheers! üçª

## Installation
This package only includes extractors for now. To install, navigate to your **System** menu, then choose **Inputs**. From there, locate your Syslog input and click the **Manage extractors** button. 

Click **Actions** then **Import extractors**, and then paste the contents of graylog-vyos-extractors.json into the box on the page. Click **Add extractors to input** then click the **Back** button in your browser. You should now see all of the extractors listed. 

### Important!
Keep in mind that if you import again, you're adding to what's already there: It doesn't "update" the existing with your new import. So you'll need to delete any extractors you plan to re-import.

## Testing Information
This has only been tested on my own Graylog install (Ubuntu 22.04.1 w/Graylog, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch running under Docker), against my own VyOS VM at home (1.4.x-sagitta).

If you use this project and test it against anything else, open an issue and I'll get your testing added to the README.

One thing of note is that I'm using the Zone-based Firewall in VyOS, so my firewall rulesets are named like InputZone-OutputZone and InputZone-OutputZone-v6. These extractors SHOULD handle interface-based firewalls just fine, but I haven't got around to testing it yet.

## LICENSE
See included LICENSE file. 

I've included the MIT license because it's as close to "I really don't care what you do with it, but it hope it helps you in some way" as I could get.
